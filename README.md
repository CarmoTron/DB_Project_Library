# DB_Project_Library
 Project with database
 ----------------------------

This project was developed by me while I was in school taking the Computer Programmer course. We were asked to create a Windows Forms application based on databases we had previously created in an exercise. It was challenging to set up the server, handle shutdowns, and perform SQL injections and verifications.
